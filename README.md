# CSC119_Final
This was my final for my CSC119 class at ACC. It's a text adventure game called Mad Maze. Very basic, not too intelligent, might make a better version of this game in the future. Make sure you have a pencil and paper when playing to keep track of where you've been in this maze.

## Instructions

1) Clone the repo
2) Inside of whichever terminal you use, navigate to the repo and type "py main.py" to start the game.

## Notes

- Make sure you're using Python 3
- Try to use a terminal that supports color like Git Bash, because in the cmd terminal it looks terrible!
- Make sure you have fun
